\textbf{Abstract.} This paper deals with the concepts of machine learning and data mining social networks, which are increasingly useful for businesses to know the consumers' sentiment towards their brand. This project, intended for use by engineers at Orange France, focuses on the development of a micro-services architecture built around the open source cluster computing framework Apache Spark. Thanks to is distributed model, Spark can process massive amounts of data stored in databases as well as real time data streamed from social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Orange forum websites. These data are then stored in a cluster database and exposed by an Application Programming Interface (API) server for users to see them in real time.
